<b>[Verse 1]</b><br>
When we're out in a crowd laughing loud<br>
And nobody knows why<br>
When we're lost at a club, getting drunk<br>
And you give me that smile<br>
Going home in the back of a car<br>
And your hand touches mine<br>
When we're done making love<br>
And you look up and give me those eyes<br>
<br>
<b>[Chorus]</b><br>
'Cause all of the small things that you do<br>
Are what remind me why I fell for you<br>
And when we're apart, and I'm missing you<br>
I close my eyes and all I see is you<br>
And the small things you do<br>
<br>
<b>[Verse 2]</b><br>
When you call me at night while you're out<br>
Getting high with your friends (high with your friends)<br>
Every "hi", every "bye", every "I love you" you've ever said<br>
(You've ever said)<br>
<br>
<b>[Chorus]</b><br>
'Cause all of the small things that you do<br>
Are what remind me why I fell for you<br>
And when we're apart, and I'm missing you<br>
I close my eyes and all I see is you<br>
And the small things you do<br>
<br>
<b>[Instrumental Break]</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>[Bridge]</b><br>
When we're done making love<br>
And you look up and give me those eyes<br>
<br>
<b>[Chorus]</b><br>
'Cause all of the small things that you do<br>
Are what remind me why I fell for you<br>
And when we're apart, and I'm missing you<br>
I close my eyes and all I see is you<br>
And the small things you do<br>
<br>
<b>[Outro]</b><br>
All the small things you do<br>
