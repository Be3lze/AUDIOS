<b>[Verse 1: Harry]</b><br>
Maybe it's the way she walked (ow)<br>
Straight into my heart and stole it<br>
Through the doors and past the guards (ow)<br>
Just like she already owned it<br>
<br>
<b>[Pre-Chorus: Zayn]</b><br>
I said, "Can you give it back to me?"<br>
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"<br>
<br>
<b>[Chorus: All]</b><br>
And we danced all night to the best song ever<br>
We knew every line, now I can't remember<br>
How it goes, but I know that I won't forget her<br>
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever<br>
<br>
<b>[Post-Chorus: All]</b><br>
I think it went, oh, oh, oh<br>
I think it went, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
I think it goes... (ooh)<br>
<br>
<b>[Verse 2: Liam, Harry]</b><br>
Said her name was Georgia Rose (ow)<br>
And her daddy was a dentist<br>
Said, I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)<br>
But she kissed me like she meant it<br>
<br>
<b>[Pre-Chorus: Niall]</b><br>
I said, "Can I take you home with me?"<br>
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"<br>
<br>
<b>[Chorus: All]</b><br>
And we danced all night to the best song ever<br>
We knew every line, now I can't remember<br>
How it goes, but I know that I won't forget her<br>
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever<br>
<br>
<b>[Post-Chorus: All]</b><br>
I think it went, oh, oh, oh<br>
I think it went, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
I think it goes... (ooh)<br>
<br>
<b>[Bridge: Louis, Zayn, All, Harry]</b><br>
You know, I know, you know I'll remember you<br>
And I know, you know, I know you'll remember me<br>
And you know, I know, you know I'll remember you<br>
And I know, you know, I hope you'll remember how we danced<br>
How we danced (one, two, one, two, three, ow!)<br>
<br>
<b>[Chorus: All, Zayn, Harry]</b><br>
How we danced all night to the best song ever<br>
We knew every line, now I can't remember<br>
How it goes, but I know that I won't forget her<br>
'Cause we danced (we danced) all night to the best song ever (it goes something like this)<br>
And we danced all night to the best song ever<br>
We knew every line, now I can't remember<br>
How it goes, but I know that I won't forget her<br>
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever<br>
<br>
<b>[Post-Chorus: All]</b><br>
I think it went, oh, oh, oh<br>
I think it went, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
I think it goes... (ooh)<br>
<br>
<b>[Outro: Zayn]</b><br>
Best song ever<br>
It was the best song ever<br>
It was the best song ever<br>
It was the best song ever<br>
