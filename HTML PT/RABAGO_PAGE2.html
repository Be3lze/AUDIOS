		<b>[Intro]<br></b>
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
<br>
Dreaming about the things that we could be
<br>
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
<br>
Said, "No more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars"
<br>
Yeah, we'll be counting stars
<br>
<br>
<b>[Verse 1]</b><br>
I see this life, like a swinging vine
<br>
Swing my heart across the line
<br>
And in my face is flashing signs
<br>
Seek it out and ye shall find
<br>
<br>
<b>[Refrain]</b><br>
Old, but I'm not that old
<br>
Young, but I'm not that bold
<br>
And I don't think the world is sold
<br>
On just doing what we're told
<br>
<br>
<b>[Pre-Chorus]</b><br>
I feel something so right
<br>
Doing the wrong thing
<br>
And I feel something so wrong
<br>
Doing the right thing
<br>
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
<br>
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
<br>
<br>
<b>[Chorus]</b><br>
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
<br>
Dreaming about the things that we could be
<br>
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
<br>
Said, "No more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars"
<br>
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
<br>
Dreaming about the things we could be
<br>
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
<br>
Said, "No more counting dollars, we'll be, we'll be counting stars"
<br>
Yeah, yeah
<br>
<br>
<b>[Verse 2]</b><br>
I feel your love, and I feel it burn
<br>
Down this river, every turn
<br>
Hope is our four-letter word
<br>
Make that money, watch it burn
<br>
<br>
<b>[Refrain]</b><br>
Old, but I'm not that old
<br>
Young, but I'm not that bold
<br>
And I don't think the world is sold
<br>
On just doing what we're told
<br>
<br>
<b>[Pre-Chorus]</b><br>
And I feel something so wrong
<br>
Doing the right thing
<br>
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
<br>
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly
<br>
<br>
<b>[Chorus]</b><br>
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
<br>
Dreaming about the things that we could be
<br>
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
<br>
Said, "No more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars"
<br>
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
<br>
Dreaming about the things that we could be
<br>
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
<br>
Said, "No more counting dollars, we'll be, we'll be counting stars"
<br>
<br>
<b>[Bridge]</b><br>
Oh, take that money, watch it burn
<br>
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
<br>
Take that money, watch it burn
<br>
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
<br>
Take that money, watch it burn
<br>
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
<br>
Take that money, watch it burn
<br>
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
<br>
<br>
<b>[Pre-Chorus]</b><br>
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
<br>
<br>
<b>[Chorus]</b><br>
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
<br>
Dreaming about the things that we could be
<br>
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
<br>
Said, "No more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars"
<br>
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
<br>

<br>
<br>
<b>[Outro]</b><br>
Take that money, watch it burn
<br>
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
<br>
Take that money, watch it burn
<br>
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
<br>
Take that money, watch it burn
<br>
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
<br>
Take that money, watch it burn
<br>
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
